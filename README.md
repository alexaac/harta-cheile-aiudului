# Harta Cheilor Aiudului

This is an old map from 2011 made with [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/) and [GDAL2Tiles](http://www.klokan.cz/projects/gdal2tiles/).

It is displayed using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) and uses [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) as basemap.

Aiudului Gorges (Cheile Aiudului) is a beautiful place for climbing in Trascăului Mountains, România (lat=46.37716&lon=23.58264).

The map is currently available at [Harta Cheilor Aiudului](http://cheileaiudului.ro/sites/default/files/harta_chei/chei.html).

For now, this is work in progress, I intend to update it. :)
